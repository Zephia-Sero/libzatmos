# ZAtmos is an atmospherics engine library for simulating gas flow and reactions.

This is being made for another project, but I uploaded the library here separately
in case someone else might want to use it.

## How to Use

First, clone the repository somewhere, then build like so:

```sh
cmake .
make
```

Once it's built, check out `zatmoslib-demo` and the `demo/` directory for a simple
use of the library. Enjoy!

Library will probably always be provided as source code, cause I'm too lazy to
upload prebuilt versions.
