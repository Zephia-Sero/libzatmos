# LibZAtmos is an atmospherics/thermodynamics engine library for simulating gas flow and reactions.

This is being made for another project, but I uploaded the library here separately
in case someone else might want to use it.

## How to Use

First, recursive-clone (includes raylib submodule) the repository somewhere and cd into it:

```sh
git clone --recursive "https://github.com/Zephia-Sero/libzatmos"
cd libzatmos
```

Then, simply build with cmake and make:

```sh
cmake .
make
```

Once it's built, check out `libzatmos-demo` and the `demo/` directory for a basic
use of the library. Enjoy!

Library will probably always be provided as source code, cause I'm too lazy to
upload prebuilt versions.
